    -title: SOUNDS IN CITIES
    description: "Sound plays a critical and complex role in the way we experience urban spaces. Today, cities treat urban sound as “noise”, an isolated nuisance that should be mitigated when problems arise. But sound can also support our well-being, orientation, focus, and our lasting memories of urban spaces - even the city as a whole (e.g. music, conversation, bird chirping, water sounds)."

  title: Pourquoi le son est important ?
  description: Souvent décrit comme la « nouvelle fumée secondaire », le <strong>bruit est un polluant majeur</strong> de notre époque, avec des conséquences allant de la gêne et de la perte auditive jusqu'à la mort prématurée. Une mauvaise gestion du bruit a également des conséquences environnementales, car des ressources et un espace précieux sont gaspillés.

    description:
      "In Quebec alone, 1 out 5 people is highly annoyed with noise and the
      cost of noise is estimated at 871 M$ per year. Large cities are
      particularly prone to conflicts around unwanted sounds due to increased
      densification, mixed uses, diverse economies, and nightlife.
      <strong> Yet, not all sound is noise.</strong> Many sound-producing
      activities contribute to
      <strong> vitality and attractiveness of cities,</strong> including
      transportation, tourism, leisure, outdoor festivals and other cultural
      events. "

    description: "However, guidelines and policies rely almost exclusively on <strong>sound levels</strong> (in decibels), which, alone, fails to capture the complexity of people’s diverse <strong>experiences of urban sounds.</strong> "

  footer_descscription:
    "This complexity includes positive outcomes of sound (well-being,
    orientation, and community-building), the variety of stakeholders involved
    (across disciplines, sectors, communities and levels of government), and,
    critically, the social underpinnings of noise. <br><br>
    This is particularly true in Canada, where city-makers consider sound as
    an afterthought, if at all, through corrective measures when people submit
    complaints. Not only is this noise control strategy too little and too
    late, it also fails to build fairness into our cities. Indeed minoritized
    communities are subject to more stringent policing, and more likely to be
    exposed to higher noise levels."
